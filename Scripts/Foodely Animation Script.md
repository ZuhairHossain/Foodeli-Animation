#Foodely Animation

#Scene 1: ( Mehedi Hasan )
In the beginning of scene 1,  we will see a village outside of Dhaka like, Sherpur ,where there will be very few people on the road and we will hear an ambulance siren. It will be understood that corona is going on in the country. Then zoom into the main character’s room which is far away from the village area. Main character will read a book or do something else. 


#Scene 2: (Yamin Ara, Saima Rahman Tasnia, Fahmida Ahmed Hridy )
Main  Character will feel bored while sitting at home and will think of restaurant food (pictures of food with thought bubbles). After a while she will pick a phone and will start scrolling Facebook. Facebook scroll will be shown by zooming in. While scrolling through Facebook, she will suddenly be happy to see an ad for an online food delivery service. She will select the food on their page and place the order. Then zoom out from the phone and call the delivery man and leave the phone when the order is placed. 

#Scene 3: (Zuhair Hossain,Zahrun Zannat Pian) 
The road will be shown by zooming out from the main character’s room,  where the delivery man will take the delivery in a short time and knock on the gate of the character or press the calling bell. Then when she opens the gate, the delivery man will hand over the order to her and she will pay him. She will close the gate and sit in the room with the parcel, we will see her happy face. 
Note: when the character will open the gate to take her order from the delivery man, both will wear masks and gloves. 

#Ending: motto will be written below the foodeli logo. Then when the logo and motto will be gone , the name Foodeli appears on the screen.
